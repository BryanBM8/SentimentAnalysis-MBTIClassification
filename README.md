Analysis of the Relationship Between MBTI and Sentiment Analysis

Our development was carried out in order to conduct research on the validity of MBTI in the way a person expresses his emotions in terms of expressing opinions on social media, especially Twitter. Our methodology involves Machine Learning models such as Naive Bayes and SVC while for Deep Learning models we involve DistilBERT. This research is still in the development stage where each feature has run properly with an accuracy above 75%, the development carried out is to automate the discovery of the linkage of MBTI detection features and their relationship with sentiment analysis without being checked manually.
